## if statement
Only runs code if given condition is true.
```
let rating = 3;

if(rating === 3) {
console.log("YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!");
}
```


Note, there is a better to write this using an else statement, but this is how if-statements can be used. 
```
let random = Math.random();

if (random < 0.5) {

console.log("Your number is less than 0.5");

console.log(random);

}

  

if (random >= 0.5) {

console.log("Your number is greater than 0.5");

console.log(random);

}
```
