Arrays are a data structure. 
A data structure allows you to group data together.
Arrays are an ordered collection of values. 


To make an empty array:
```
let students = []
```

An array of strings:
```
let colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow'];
```

An array of numbers:
```
let lottoNums = [19, 22, 56, 12, 51];
```

A mixed array:
```
let stuff = [true, 48, 'cat', null];
```



Another example:
```
let days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"]

days.length 
> 3

[].length 
> 0 


```
