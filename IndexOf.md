Provides the indices of an array.

```

let pets = ["blue", "kitty", "rusty", "wyatt"]
pets.indexOf('rusty')
2

pets.indexOf('kitty')
1


//this is an easy way to check if something is in an array or not, if it returns -1, it's not.
pets.indexOf('adidas')
-1
```

Note: if there are two of the same elements in an array. It will only give you the first match.
