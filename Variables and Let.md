Variables are labels for values.
We can store a value and give it a name so that we can refer back to it later. 
Use that value to do stuff.
Or change it to another variable. 

Syntax:

let variableName = value;

e.g. let year = 1978; 

Make me a variable called year and give it a value of 1978.

Variables can be recalled:
```
let numHens = 5;
let numRoosters = 1;

let totalNum = numHens + numRoosters
6



```

This does not change the value of either variable.

let totalChickens = numHens + numRoosters

or numHens = numHens + 1;

Please note, that totalNum is stored at that place in time, if numHens is updated, totalNum will not change unless that variable is defined again later in the code.
