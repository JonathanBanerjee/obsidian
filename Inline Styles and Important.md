Both inline styles and important are rarely used.
Inline styles are more specific than ID's, classes and elements. 

E.g. 

```
<button id="signup" style="color: blue">Sign Up</button>
```


!important will override anything. However, this is rarely used. 

E.g.

```
button {
background-color: magenta !important;
}
```
