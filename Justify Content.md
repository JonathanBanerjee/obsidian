This determines how the content is distributed across the main axis.

`justify-content: flex-start;`

Adds space between edges but not on on the outside elements:
`justify-content: space-between;`

Give each element the same amount of space around it:
`justify-content: space-around;`

Space evenly between every element and the container:
`justify-content: space-evenly;`

justify-content can be dependant on flex-direction, if flex-direction is set to a column, it will go down the page, if it is set to row, it will go across the page.
