The hard rules:

You can use an underscore 
You can use numbers.
You cannot start off with a digit.
You can't have spaces.

Give your variables names that are camelCased (lowercase for the first word, no underscores just give the latter first letters of each word in uppercase e.g. currentYear = 1999; )


When using boolean be more descriptive, e.g.
Don't use loggedInUser, use isLoggedIn.
Putting "is" in there makes it clearer.
