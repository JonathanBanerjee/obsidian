Strings represent text, they are a string of characters.
They must be wrapped in quotes. 

You can use double quotes or single quotes, however, you should remain consistent in your naming.

e.g. letfavAnimal = 'Dumbo Octopus'

Note the string of "24" is not the same as the number.

You can use single quotes within double quotes:
e.g.

"I told her 'go away!' "

You should never have a single quote close wqith a double quote or vice versa.
