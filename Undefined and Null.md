These are both primitive values.

Null - "Intentional absence of any value"
Must be assigned.
For example: 
```
let loggedInUser = null; //Value is explicitly nothing.

loggedInUser = 'Alan Rickman';
```

Undefined 
Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined. 

Think of undefined as meaning "I don't know - I don't know the value."
