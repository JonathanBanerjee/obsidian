Rotate takes radians, gradians, degrees or turns.
`transform: rotate (45deg);`
`transform: rotate (3.141rad);`
`transform: rotate (-50grad);`
`transform: rotate (1.75turn);`

deg - Degrees, one full circle is 360deg.

grad - Gradians, one fill circle is 400grad

rad - Radians, one full circle is 2pi radians or 6.2832rad.

turn - Number of turns. One full circle is 1turn. 

You can move the place where it rotates from by using transform origin 
```
transform-origin: bottom right;
```
