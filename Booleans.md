These are true or false which are two keywords in JavaScript. 

let isActiveGame = true;

isActiveGame 
> true

isActiveGame = false;
> false


This is used a lot to see if a user is logged in. 
isLoggedIn = false;


Note variables can change types, however, TypeScript will enable you to enforce those restrictions. 
e.g. numPuppies = 23; // Number
numPuppies = false;  // Now a Boolean
numPuppies = 100;  // Back to Number!
